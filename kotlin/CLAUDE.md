# Kotlin App Development

## About
Multiple Kotlin applications which could also be Android native apps developed using Kotlin and Gradle

## Guidelines
- Keep simple
- Assume no prior Kotlin dev knowledge
- Small, atomic steps
- Individual tests only
- Wait for explicit approval between phases
- Focus and independence per app

## My Tooling
- I use SDKMAN! CLI for Gradle, Maven, and Java version control and installation
- I use IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition to read the codes

## My Workflow
1. **Research**: Create `2-RESEARCH.md` implementation plan
2. **Review**: Wait for user approval
3. **Plan**: Create detailed `3-PLAN.md` with atomic steps
4. **Implement**: Execute step-by-step, mark "(COMPLETED)"
