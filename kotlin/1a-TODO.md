## TASK:
* I have an android shell app folder added to the current directory called android8__api26__webview__springboot
* How should I go about prototyping my android shell app's home screen to have the following functionalities:
* The first clickable icon is called "Send Money".
    * Upon click "Send Money" button on the app's home screen it will display a simple WebView app to show a send money page. The send money page will have two fields. The first field is to enter phone number (no validation required) and second field is to enter amount (no validation required). In the send money webview app, besides those two fields, it will also have a "Send Money" button.
* The second clickable icon is called "Car"
* Upon clicking the "Book Car" button on the app's home screen it will display another simple WebView app to show the book car page. The book car page will have two fields. The first field is to enter my current location (no validation required). The second field is to enter the destination location (no validation required). Then it will also have a "Book Car" button.
