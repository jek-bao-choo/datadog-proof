* Please research how it can be done.
* In your research explain how Datadog Operator works in Openshift cluster and how is a Datadog Agent going to run in the Openshift cluster as well as if there is Datadog OpenTelemetry Collector that comes with it. Also please explain how Datadog Operator work. 
    * Explain these using simple diagrams are welcomed.
