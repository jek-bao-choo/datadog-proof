# Project Overview

## Purpose
This is a Next.js 15.4 payment application using React 19.1. It's a mobile-optimized payment form that allows users to send payments by entering a phone number and amount.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4 with React 19.1
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Custom UI components (Button, Input, Card, Label)
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support

## Code Structure
- `app/` - Next.js app router pages
- `components/` - Reusable React components
  - `ui/` - Base UI components
  - `forms/` - Form components
- `lib/` - Utility functions and validations
- `public/` - Static assets

## Current Color Scheme Issue
The app has poor contrast with light text on light backgrounds, making it hard to read. The color scheme needs to be improved for better accessibility and readability.
