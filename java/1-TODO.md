## TASK:
- Walk me through creating a Java 8 app running on tomcat
- What is the specific version of the Java 8 app?
- What other options do I have for running a java app besides tomcat?
- What framework should I use for my app? Should I use Spring framework?


<!-- ## EXAMPLES:
- [List any example files in the examples folders and explain how they should be used if any] -->

<!-- ## Documentation:
- **FastAPI**: https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi -->

## USE CONTEXT7
- use libraries /openjdk/jdk and /ziphtracks/javalearningmanual and /apache/tomcat and /spring-projects/spring-boot

## Implementation should consider:
- **README.md**: Include setup, deployment, verification, and cleanup steps
- **Git Ignore**: Create a .gitignore to avoid committing common Python files or output to Git repo
- **Simplicity**: Keep the Python project really simple
- **PII and Sensitive Data**: Do be mindful that I will be committing the Python project to a public Github repo so do NOT commit private key or secrets.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- My computer is a Macbook
- My development tools are iTerm2, tmux, Claude Code, and Visual Studio Code
- Explain the steps you would take in clear, beginner-friendly language
- Write the research on performing the task
- Save the research to `2-RESEARCH.md`
