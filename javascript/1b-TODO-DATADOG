## TASK:
* I want to add Feature Flag to the entire Payee feature in the react19dot1__vite7dot1__sendmoney project.
* Below are the steps from Datadog's documentation https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/feature_flags/ 
```
Step 1: Import and initialize the SDK
First, install @datadog/openfeature-browser, @openfeature/web-sdk, and @openfeature/core as dependencies in your project:

yarn add @datadog/openfeature-browser @openfeature/web-sdk @openfeature/core
Then, add the following to your project to initialize the SDK:

import { DatadogProvider } from '@datadog/openfeature-browser';
import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

// Initialize the provider
const provider = new DatadogProvider({
   clientToken: '<CLIENT_TOKEN>',
   applicationId: '<APPLICATION_ID>',
   enableExposureLogging: true, // Can impact RUM costs if enabled
   site: 'datadoghq.com',
   env: '<YOUR_ENV>', // Same environment normally passed to the RUM SDK
   service: '<SERVICE_NAME>',
   version: '1.0.0',
});

// Set the provider
await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(provider);
Setting enableExposureLogging to true can impact RUM costs, as it sends exposure events to Datadog through RUM. You can disable it if you don't need to track feature exposure or guardrail metric status.
More information about OpenFeature SDK configuration options can be found in its documentation. For more information on creating client tokens and application IDs, see API and Application Keys.

Step 2: Create a feature flag
Use the feature flags creation UI to bootstrap your first feature flag. By default, the flag is disabled in all environments.

Step 3: Evaluate the flag and write feature code
In your application code, use the SDK to evaluate the flag and gate the new feature.

import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

const client = OpenFeature.getClient();

// If applicable, set relevant attributes on the client's global context
// (e.g. org id, user email)
await OpenFeature.setContext({
   org: { id: 2 },
   user: { id: 'user-123', email: 'user@example.com' },
   targetingKey: 'user-123',
});

// This is what the SDK returns if the flag is disabled in
// the current environment
const fallback = false;

const showFeature = await client.getBooleanValue('show-new-feature', fallback);
if (showFeature) {
   // Feature code here
}
After you’ve completed this step, redeploy the application to pick up these changes. Additional usage examples can be found in the SDK’s documentation.

Step 4: Define targeting rules and enable the feature flag
Now that the application is ready to check the value of your flag, you can start adding targeting rules. Targeting rules enable you to define where or to whom to serve different variants of your feature.

Go to Feature Flags, select your flag, then find the Targeting Rules & Rollouts section. Select the environment whose rules you want to modify, and click Edit Targeting Rules.

Targeting Rules & Rollouts
Step 5: Publish the rules in your environments
After saving changes to the targeting rules, publish those rules by enabling your flag in the environment of your choice.

As a general best practice, changes should be rolled out in a Staging environment before rolling out in Production.
In the Targeting Rules & Rollouts section, toggle your selected environment to Enabled.

Publish targeting rules
The flag serves your targeting rules in this environment. You can continue to edit these targeting rules to control where the variants are served.

Step 6: Monitor your rollout
Monitor the feature rollout from the feature flag details page, which provides real-time exposure tracking and metrics such as error rate and page load time. As you incrementally release the feature with the flag, view the Real-Time Metric Overview panel in the Datadog UI to see how the feature impacts application performance.

## USE CONTEXT7
* use library id /datadog/browser-sdk
<!-- * use library id /datadog/dd-sdk-android-gradle-plugin -->

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
* Append setup, deployment, verification, and cleanup steps in README-DATADOG-FEATURE-FLAG.md only after the above task is fully completed
* Explain the steps you would take in clear, beginner-friendly language
* Write the research on performing the task
* Save the research to `2-RESEARCH.md`
