## TASK:
* Instrument a Javascript app and the dependencies of the app is in package.json
* After installing the `@datadog/browser-rum` and `@datadog/browser-rum-react` packages from npm.
* Datadog provided a sample code and instruct that I initialize it as early as possible with the following to start tracking data with Datadog:
```javascript
import { datadogRum } from '@datadog/browser-rum';
import { reactPlugin } from '@datadog/browser-rum-react';

datadogRum.init({
    applicationId: '<REDACTED>',
    clientToken: '<REDACTED>',
    site: 'datadoghq.com',
    service:'react19dot1-vite7dot1-sendmoney',
    env: 'test',
    
    // Specify a version number to identify the deployed version of your application in Datadog
    version: '1.0.1',
    sessionSampleRate:  100,
    sessionReplaySampleRate: 100,
    defaultPrivacyLevel: 'mask-user-input',
    plugins: [reactPlugin({ router: true })],
});
```
* Please take note that my application code is a React version 19.1.X written with Javascript, not Typescript.
* Please research and write down a research plan on how to go about instrumenting and initiating my React application written in Javascript with Datadog Browser RUM SDK.
