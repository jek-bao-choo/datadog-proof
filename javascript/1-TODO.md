## EXPLANATION
- You need to explain what Next.js version you propose
- What Next.js architecture do you propose
- What Next.js page routing approach do you propose

## Implementation should consider:
- **README.md**: Include setup, deployment, verification, and cleanup steps
- **Git Ignore**: Create a .gitignore to avoid committing common Javascript files or output to Git repo
- **Simplicity**: Keep the Javascript project really simple
- **PII and Sensitive Data**: Do be mindful that I will be committing the Javascript project to a public Github repo so do NOT commit private key or secrets.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- My computer is a Macbook
- My development tools are iTerm2, tmux, Claude Code, and Visual Studio Code
- Explain the steps you would take in clear, beginner-friendly language
- Write the research on performing the task
- Save the research to `2-RESEARCH.md`
