# React + Vite for Send Money

Get started using Vite to build a React JS app

```
npm create vite@latest
```

Vite will now ask you a few questions. Answer them as follows:

Project name: Enter a name for your app, like my-webview-app.

Select a framework: Use the arrow keys to choose React.

Select a variant: Choose JavaScript.

```
npm run build

npm run dev
```

The terminal will now show you a message that the server is running and give you a local URL, usually http://localhost:5173/
