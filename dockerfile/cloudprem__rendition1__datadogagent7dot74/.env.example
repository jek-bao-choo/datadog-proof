# Datadog API Configuration
# Note: Logs are sent to CloudPrem (localhost:7280), not Datadog cloud
# However, the agent still requires an API key to start up

# Option 1: Use a dummy key (for local CloudPrem-only setup)
DD_API_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000

# Option 2: Use a real key (if you also want to send metrics to Datadog cloud)
# Get your API key from: https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys
# DD_API_KEY=your_actual_datadog_api_key_here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# 2. For CloudPrem-only: Keep the dummy key as is
# 3. For Datadog cloud metrics: Replace with your actual API key
# 4. Never commit the .env file to Git (it's already in .gitignore)
