## TASK:
- Create a simple .NET 6 application
- Keep simple (Hello World level)
- Answer my questions: 
    - What do I need to have as pre-requisites for running this application on a Macbook?
    - What server should I run it on?
- Think hard

## USE CONTEXT7
- use library /websites/learn_microsoft-en-us-dotnet
- use library /websites/learn_microsoft-en-us-dotnet-csharp?tokens=5000
- use library /websites/playwright_dev-dotnet?tokens=5000

## IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATION:
- **README.md**: Include setup, start up, deployment, verification, and cleanup steps
- **Git Ignore**: Create a .gitignore to avoid committing common Python files or output to Git repo
- **Simplicity**: Keep the Python project really simple
- **PII and Sensitive Data**: Do be mindful that I will be committing the Python project to a public Github repo so do NOT commit private key or secrets.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- My development tools are iTerm and Visual Studio Code
- Explain the steps you would take in clear, beginner-friendly language
- Write the research on performing the task
- Save the research to `2-RESEARCH.md`
