## Task
- Research how do I use this Terraform module in this github repo https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-gcp-datadog-integration for Log Collection Integration of Google Cloud Platform to Datadog
<!-- - Research how to NOT create a new NAT Gateway (instead provides an option to re-use an existing NAT Gateway that is already in the GCP environment) to collect logs from GCP and send logs from GCP via Dataflow to Datadog. 
    - This Github repo that will contain more information is here https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-gcp-datadog-integration
    - The architecture diagram of the terraform creation is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-gcp-datadog-integration/refs/heads/main/gcp-to-datadog-diagram.png
    - Once the research is done, add your thoughts to the below steps on how to NOT create a new NAT Gateway instead it will re-use and existing NAT Gateway. -->
